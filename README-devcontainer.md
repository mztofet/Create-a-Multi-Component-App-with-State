### Steps to Set Up Your Development Environment with `.devcontainer`

1. **Ensure Docker Desktop is Running**  
   - Open Docker Desktop on your machine.
   - Verify that the Docker engine is running. You should see the Docker icon in your system tray or menu bar indicating that it's active.

2. **Open Your Project in VS Code**  
   - Launch Visual Studio Code.  
   - Use the **File > Open Folder** option to open your application folder.

3. **Reopen in Dev Container**  
   - VS Code will automatically detect the `.devcontainer` folder.  
   - A notification will appear at the bottom-right corner of the editor asking:  
     *"This folder contains a Dev Container configuration. Would you like to reopen it in a container?"*  
   - Click **"Reopen in Container"**.  
   - VS Code will now build the development container using the `devcontainer.json`.

4. **Wait for the Setup to Complete**  
   - Once the container is built, VS Code will automatically run any `postCreateCommand` specified in the `devcontainer.json` file.  
   - For example, it will execute `npm install` to install your project dependencies.

5. **Start Working on the Application**  
   - After the setup is complete, your development environment is ready.

### Running the Application with Expo - After Finalizing Everything

1. **Start the Expo Development Server**

     ```bash
     npx expo start
     ```

2. **Choose a Platform to Run the App**
   - Use one of the following methods to run the app:
     - Press `i` to run on an iOS simulator.
     - Press `a` to run on an Android emulator.
     - Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on your physical device.

3. **Test the Application**
   - Interact with the login screen to ensure animations, form validation, and reusable components are functioning as expected.
